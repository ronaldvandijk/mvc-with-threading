/**
 * The MVCDynamicModelThreadGenaralized application illustrates the 
 * Model View Controller concept via a simple Swing application.
 * Two displays are updated via shared model that implements a Thread.
 * 
 * The MVC uses a pull implementation of the observer pattern. Whenever 
 * changes in the model occur the observers pull the relevant information 
 * from the model.
 * 
 * In this example the controller is not aware of the view, since no 
 * GUI elements need to be modified based on the state of the model.
