 * The model is not much more than an incrementing amount. There is a class 
 * variable that holds the current (integer) amount, a setter and a getter. The 
 * main responsibility of this class is to keep track of the amount and 
 * incement it's value. The class implements the interface Runnable. 
 * This means the code can run 'independent' of the mainthread and as 
 * a result the GUI of the application remains responsive during run.
